# 42cursus

Coding developed at the 42cursus - begin date: 20/jan/2020.

## About 42

	42 is a global education initiative that proposes a new way of learning technology: no teachers,
	no classrooms, students learning from their fellow students (peer to peer learning), with a
	methodology that develops both computing and life skills. The 42 cursus is free for whoever is
	approved in its selection process, becoming thus "cadets" (42's students).

## 42's galaxy (curriculum)

The 42cursus comprises two groups of projects: the first one being known as "inner circle" and the second one, "outer treks" - due to the Holy Graph layout (see image above). The "inner circle" is the basic curriculum, with all projects being mandatory to attain level 7 - which is the minimun level required for activities such as internships and interchange. The "outer treks" are a collection of diverse project trails in subjects ranging from operational systems to web development that allows cadets to specialize in such subjects.
